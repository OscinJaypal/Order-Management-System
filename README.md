# Order-Management-System
Order Management System project leverages Python progrmming language for the logic execution and SQL for database management. 

Python is used to handle the business logic and interaction with the SQL database. It manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations effectively, ensuring that the order management system performs the basic operations in each section of the system, mainly the operations performed are;

Add:
New records are added to the system by inserting relevant details (such as order ID, customer information, products, etc.) into the database. This ensures that each record is accurately recorded for processing and tracking.

Update:
Existing recordss may need updates, such as modifying quantities or updating prices. This is done by executing SQL UPDATE statements through Python, ensuring that the database reflects the most current record information.

Delete:
The records can be deleted from the system if they are canceled or no longer valid. This involves executing SQL DELETE statements through Python to remove the corresponding records from the database.


## Methodology
